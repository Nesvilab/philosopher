## Why partially ?

Third-party software like the _prophets_ will only work on Linux (Debian and Red Hat based) and Windows systems. The remaining functions will work on the above list. Also, the ProteoWizard tools _msconvert_ and _idconvert_ are only offered to GNU/Linux ad Unix operating systems.

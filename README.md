#### Philosopher is fast, easy-to-use, scalable, and versatile data analysis software for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Philosopher is dependency-free and can analyze both traditional database searches and open searches for post-translational modification (PTM) discovery. 

- Database downloading and formatting.

- Peptide-spectrum matching with Comet.

- Peptide assignment validation with PeptideProphet.

- Multi-level integrative analysis with iProphet.

- PTM site localization with PTMProphet.

- Protein inference with ProteinProphet.

- FDR filtering with custom algorithms.

  - Two-dimensional filtering for simultaneous control of PSM and Protein FDR levels.
  - Sequential FDR estimation for large data sets using filtered PSM and proteins lists.

- Label-free quantification via spectral counting and MS1 intensities.

- Label-based quantification using TMT and iTRAQ.

- Quantification based on functional protein groups.

- Multi-level detailed reports for peptides, ions, and proteins.

## Features
Philosopher provides easy access to third-party tools and custom algorithms for proteomics analysis, from database searching to functional protein reports. Philosopher is also well-equipped for open search analysis, providing extended versions of PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet for peptide validation and protein inference. To date, Philosopher is the only proteomics toolkit that allows you to process and analyze closed and open search results.

- Database downloading and formatting.

- Peptide-spectrum matching with Comet.

- Peptide assignment validation with PeptideProphet.

- Multi-level integrative analysis with iProphet.

- PTM site localization with PTMProphet.

- Protein inference with ProteinProphet.

- FDR filtering with custom algorithms.

  - Two-dimensional filtering for simultaneous control of PSM and Protein FDR levels.
  - Sequential FDR estimation for large data sets using filtered PSM and proteins lists.

- Label-free quantification via spectral counting and MS1 intensities.

- Label-based quantification using TMT isobaric tags.

- Quantification based on functional protein groups.

- Multi-level detailed reports including peptides, ions, and proteins.

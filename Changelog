### Added
- Support for TMT-16 plex.

### Changed
- Updated to Go v1.13.1.
- Removed RawMassDiff from the reports.
- The Delta Mass adjustment will only happen if there was no previous mass calibration during the search.
- The Corrected DeltaMass value is now used to map Unimod.
- Reports wont show isobaric labels that are not used for the analysis anymore (e.g. 10 TMT columns if only 8 are used).

### Fixed
- The filter command was throwing an error when no protein data was present.
- Report with TMT was breaking when no annotation file was present.
- Minor bugs and issues.

### Fixed
- Fixed the protein coverage calculations with partially overlapping and subsumed peptides
- Fixed an issue where peptides would map to multiple locations in the protein after having I/L converted (Needs to be used with MSFragger v3.6.1 or higher)
- Fixed an issue with report tables having no isobaric labels being reported

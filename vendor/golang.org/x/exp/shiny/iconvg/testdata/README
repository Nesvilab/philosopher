action-info.svg comes from the Material Design icon set. See
action/svg/production/ic_info_48px.svg in the
github.com/google/material-design-icons repository.

action-info.{lo,hi}res.ivg are low- and high-resolution IconVG versions of that
SVG file. Low resolution means that coordinates are quantized to 1/64th of a
unit; the graphic's size is 48 by 48 units. High resolution means that
coordinates are represented by all but the 2 least significant bits of a
float32. Each low resolution coordinate is encoded in either 1 or 2 bytes. Each
high resolution coordinate is encoded in either 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

action-info.{lo,hi}res.ivg.disassembly are disassemblies of those IconVG files.

action-info.{lo,hi}res.png are renderings of those IconVG files.

  summary: A complete toolkit for shotgun proteomics data analysis.

  # This the description of your snap. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
  # most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
  # we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
  # store.
  description: |
    Philosopher is a software designed for proteome bioinformatics analysis.

  # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
  # it is ready.
  # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
  # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
  # channels. More info about channels here:
  # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
  grade: stable

  # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
  # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
  # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
  # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
  # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
  # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
  confinement: strict
  
  # Your app's license, based on SPDX license expressions: https://spdx.org/licenses
  # Default is empty.
  license: GPL-3.0
  
  # A snap of type base to be used as the execution environment for this snap.
  # Valid values are:
  # * bare - Empty base snap;
  # * core - Ubuntu Core 16;
  # * core18 - Ubuntu Core 18.
  # Default is empty.
  #base: core18

  # Each binary built by GoReleaser is an app inside the snap. In this section
  # you can declare extra details for those binaries. It is optional.
  apps:

    # The name of the app must be the same name as the binary built or the snapcraft name.
    philosopher:

      # If your app requires extra permissions to work outside of its default
      # confined space, declare them here.
      # You can read the documentation about the available plugs and the
      # things they allow:
      # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces.
      plugs: ["home", "network", "personal-files"]

      # If you want your app to be autostarted and to always run in the
      # background, you can make it a simple daemon.

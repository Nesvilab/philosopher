# Processing, Filtering and Analyzing Open Search results using Philosopher

This example will show you how to process and analyze an open search result from MSFragger using Philosopher. This tutorial will contain as much details as possible for you to reproduce our results on your side. Keep in mind that it is expected to see small differences between some results once that these tools are under constant improvement.

We will execute our analysis using the system terminal (that "black screen" where you can type commands). A [graphical interface](https://github.com/chhh/MSFragger-GUI) is also available, but not all Philosopher commands are integrated there yet.

We will need:

* [Philosopher](https://prvst.github.io/philosopher/) (version 20180319 or higher).
* [MSFragger](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4256) (version 20180316 or higher).
* [ProteoWizard](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2377) (version 3.0.11856 or higher).
* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) version 9 (MSFragger requirement).
* The data set from [Gygi's](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3267) publication about mass tolerant database search.
* A [computer](https://image.stern.de/4238042/uncropped-620-413/f569ddaca2f32214083a9acf32009af2/Wy/mac-plus-jpg--727f7573cf759135-.jpg) running GNU/Linux or Windows with at least 8GB of RAM.

I'm running this example on a Linux Mint 18.3, it means that the commands I use below for the analysis will be "Linux compatible", if you are trying to reproduce this on a Windows machine, you will need to adjust the folder separators ('\\' for windows and '/' for Linux).


## Downloading the data set
Gygi's data set is publicly available at PRIDE under the accession number [PXD001468](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD001468). There we can see 24 files in raw and mzXML format. Download all 24 raw files, we will later convert them to mzML.


## Downloading our tools
You can download all the necessary software using the links provided above, make sure to always get the latest version available.


## Converting the raw files
We need to convert all 24 files to mzML format. The reason for not using the mzXML is the because Philosopher uses the Precursor Target Ion tag for quantifying peptides, mzXML files do not have that information available by default. When converting the files make sure to use the `peak picking` option for centroiding the peaks.


## Organizing our directory
Having all files in an organized way is important for later when running Philosopher, put all your files in a single directory, like this:

```

├── bin
│   ├── MSFragger-20180316.jar
│   └── philosopher
└── params
    └── fragger.params

2 directories, 27 files
```

Note that I also created a folder called `bin` for the software we are going to use and a folder called `params` for the parameters files.


## Creating a Workspace
Now that we have all files in place, we need to transform our directory into a Philosopher [workspace](workspace.md), using the command terminal, type:

```
$ bin/philosopher workspace --init

INFO[12:01:16] Executing Workspace 20180319
INFO[12:01:16] Creating workspace
INFO[12:01:17] Done
```

Every time you see an output on the screen it will start with the name of the command and the version of Philosopher, in my case it tells me i just ran the `workspace` command using Philosopher version 20180319.
The `workspace` command creates a local directory called `.meta` (invisible in GNU/Linux), this directory will contain all processed data for the analysis in a custom binary format for fast access.


## Fetching a human protein database
There are different ways of doing this, but we suggest you to use the Philosopher [database](database.md) command:

```
$ bin/philosopher database --id UP000005640 --reviewed --contam

INFO[12:09:32] Executing Database 20180319
INFO[12:09:32] Fetching database
INFO[12:09:48] Processing decoys
INFO[12:09:48] Creating file
INFO[12:09:59] Done
```

The `database` command connects to [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org) and fetches a bleeding edge snapshot of an organism proteome and it uses the downloaded file to create a target-decoy database. The parameter that tells Philosopher whats the organism you want is the `--id`, that code you see there is called [Proteome Identifier](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_id), to find it you have to go to the [Proteomes](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/) page on [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org) and query your organism ([UP000005640](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640) is for _Homo sapiens_).

In our example we are fetching the _Homo sapiens_ proteome containing only reviewed entries (`--reviewed`) and we are adding common contaminants (`--contam`). Our workspace now contains a protein FASTA database file.

## Doing an open database search using MSFragger
The first thing to do before running the database search is to properly set the parameter file, this is the one I'm using for this example:

```
database_name = /home/felipevl/tutorial/2018-03-21-td-UP000005640.fas

```

There are several details here that you have to pay attention before running the analysis. The first thing is to use the correct _full_ path to your recently downloaded FASTA database, the example above contains the path to mine on mine machine, so you need to replace that. Make sure that you have the `precursor_mass_lower` and `precursor_mass_upper` set to -500 and 500 respectively, and that the units are set to Daltons. I'm not going to explain all the details on the search parameter because it's not my goal right now, you can find all the necessary information on the software [manual](http://inventions.umich.edu/technologies/7143_msfragger-ultrafast-and-comprehensive-identification-of-peptides-from-tandem-mass-spectra).

Now that everything is set in place we can run MSFragger:

## Validating the peptide identifications
Having finished with the database search, now we need to run the [PeptidePrphet](peptideprophet.md) command to validate and assign confidence scores to the PSMs, this will allow us to `filter` the PSMs using a false discovery rate.

```
$ bin/philosopher peptideprophet --accmass --clevel -2 --combine --database 2018-03-21-td-UP000005640.fas --decoy rev_ --decoyprobs --expectscore --nonparam --masswidth 1000.0 *.pepXML

(...)

INFO[15:43:40] Done
```

PeptideProphet output contains a lot of log information that we don't need to focus right now. Pay attention to the number of peptides found within the charge state distribution and the number of target and decoys matches, if they are not the same I'm showing up here they should be at least very close to that. The output from this command is a new filed called `interact.pep.xml`, it contains the combined validation from all your `pepXML` files and that's what we are going to use from now on.


## Inferring proteins from peptide matches
For the protein inference and validation we will use the [ProteinProphet](proteinprophet.md) command as follows:

```
$ bin/philosopher proteinprophet --maxppmdiff 100000 interact.pep.xml

INFO[15:48:54] Executing ProteinProphet 20180319

(...)

Finished
INFO[15:59:22] Done
```

In a similar way to PeptideProphet, the output from ProteinProphet is another file called `interact.prot.xml`.


## Calculating false discovery rates (FDR)
Philosopher allows us to calculate multi-level false discovery rates through the [Filter](filter.md) command. Multi-level means that our data will be interpreted in different ways; PSMs, peptides, peptide ions and proteins, and for each layer, an FDR score will be calculated simultaneously.

The `filter` command is very versatile, it allows you to explore your data using different approaches and algorithms, you can read more about all the options available in the [documentation](filter.md). Here we are going to focus on getting similar results to the ones published before.

```

A key parameter for open search results is `--mapmods`, this option will organize and process the identifications based on the calculated delta masses. Philosopher will try to match those to entries from [UniMod](http://www.unimod.org/).

According to our results we have:

* 644654 PSMs
* 126602 Peptides
* 183106 Ions
* 9439 proteins

## Reporting
Lastly, in order to inspect our results we need to run the [Report](report.md) command.

```
$ bin/philosopher report

INFO[16:38:18] Executing Report 20180319
INFO[16:39:08] Creating Protein FASTA report

INFO[16:39:20] Creating modification reports
INFO[16:39:20] Plotting mass distribution
INFO[16:39:20] Done
```

This will create different reports based on the processed layers plus reports regarding the modification profile. This is what our workspace looks like now:

## Wrapping up

By the time your analysis is done, you should have different .tsv files in your workspace, those contains the filtered identifications and sequences like PSMs, peptides, ions and proteins.
